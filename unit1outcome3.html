<h1>Unit 1 Outcome 3 </h1>


<p>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? <br>

When making the website, I tried to be as efficient as possible, as stated, I made simple, but impactful changes such as moving my phone out of sight so I don’t get distracted. But in terms of the systems and tools we used, I felt like I had everything I needed. I’ve gotten to grips with VSCode a lot and I understand Trello sufficiently. In the past when I have dabbled in web development, when I used atom.io, I had an extension called “live-server” which I do believe is also available on VSCode, I just for some unknown reason decided to not use it. I did find this extension really convenient in the past though.  </p>

<br>

<p>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency <br>

For me personally, I found it really useful to learn keyboard shortcuts as this limits the use of a mouse, which short term isn’t much time wasted, but when you work for hours and hours having to keep switching to your mouse does waste time and not jus that, it’s much more comfortable to be able to utilise the keyboard to it’s full potential. 
Quite a sad truth, but even a simple case of putting your phone away out of sight or in a place where you won’t hear it or see it is very beneficial. Peoples whole life can be on a phone (emails, work, social networks etc)  and putting all that stuff to one side to be able to focus on one thing gives you one less thing to think about so you can put all your effort into what you’re doing. </p>

<br>

<p>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what  would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? <br>

Seen as we did the Game Project a s team, it was nice to do some independent work and use all the time towards myself. Being in a team can be both advantageous and disadvantage in such projects, but I enjoyed doing this one alone and being able to create a website from scratch is rewarding. </p>

<br>

<p>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions 
Not sure what this is asking. <br>

When I finished my website, I got my wife to test it out to double check there are no bugs or glitches and to get her opinion on what she think I could improve. If I was to do this again in the same setting, I would make more use of my classmates and slack to get peoples opinion.  </p>
