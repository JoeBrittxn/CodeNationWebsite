<p>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello ? <br>

After using Visual Studio Code for a substantial amount of time, I became familiar with the layout and functionality of it, even so preferring it over the previous text-editor I used atom.io. I will continue to use VSCode for my projects in the future. 
Same goes with Trello. There are many different applications that have similar functionality, but I found Trello really easy to use and will continue to keep using it until I find it necessary to use a different application. </p>

<br>

<p>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello ? <br>

As previously stated, especially in the case of writing up HTML, you don’t require any fancy text-editor. All you need is a standard text editor because you don’t need to run anything in the terminal it all gets displayed on the webpage. But even though it is possible to use a basic text-editor, it would (especially for a beginner) make it much more difficult due to the lack of functionality. Even the different colours in VSCode help a lot because it helps your brain distinguish between what’s what and in a standard text-editor it will just be plain black text. 
In terms of how the course was structured (Game first then Website), it was in my best interest to stick with the original application Trello as it was my first time using such programme and I had just got used to it’s functionality therefore switching over to a new but very similar program wasn’t worth my time as Trello suited my needs. </p>

<br>

<p>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? <br>

Personally, I do like the theme; the sort of dark, mustardy colours compliment my pictures nicely and the fact I used my own images that I took myself from my travels in Russia. Of course there are many improvements I could make to the website but due to time constraints I was very limited on what I could do. One bug that I really hate that I can’t seem to figure out, it when I hover over one of the links, instead of it staying on one line, it goes onto the second line. Then the navbar increases in size and moves the whole webpage down which doesn’t look professional at all. I am also aware that the writing isn’t the easiest to read and I was aware of this when I was designing my website because I knew I was going to be having my own images but I did my best to make it as readable as possible.  </p>

<br>

<p>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project. <br>

On the home page, where you have ‘Welcome.’, I wanted to have next to it “welcome”, but in Russian, but again, due to time, I couldn’t figure out how to make it so it loads, ‘Welcome.’ first, then ‘welcome’ in Russian. I thought this would’ve been a nice touch though.  </p>

<br>

<p>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose. <br>

After doing continuous testing, I believe my website is free from any errors. There isn’t a link that you click on that returns an error or takes you to the wrong place. My website is also formatted nicely. For example, on the navbar, the links are always an equal length apart. Even by just adding a slightly transparent background to my navbar gives it more definition and stands out more, making the user experience more enjoyable.  </p>
