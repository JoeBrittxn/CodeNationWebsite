<p>1.1 - Describing the purpose of IT in modern business <br>

You could probably go as far as saying that any business wouldn’t survive without the use of IT. It’s obvious to say that companies like Facebook wouldn’t survive, but even farmers/agricultural workers rely on the use of a computer to manage their business, e.g. records, finances, advertising. Information Technology is the backbone of many businesses in the modern world[2]. If a business was able to manage without the use of IT, it would be at a great disadvantage compared to it’s IT using counterparts. </p>

<br>

<p>1.2 - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need, to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? <br>

Methods - Clear and transparent goals are essential. If you have a group of 4 people all assigned to a project with one goal in mind, all 4 of those people should fully understand where the project is heading and the goal in mind. As soon as one person veers off track, the project as a whole takes a huge hit in terms of accomplishing the set-out goal. 

Skills - Each person in a group project, should possess some essential skills for a successful project: Good communication, motivation, good individual work management[3]

Resources - As mentioned in my coursework elsewhere, the Kanban method of working is an extremely useful tool to use, whether it be an individual project or a group project. It ensures that everyone in the group sticks to the set out goal, by visualising the workload onto a nicely formatted layout; specifically, the Kanban method uses cards to do this. To do this coursework, I am currently using the kanban method, using the application Trello. </p>

<br>

<p> 1.3 - Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board. <br>

To plan my website, the tool I will be using is Trello. After putting some thought into what my website will look like. I have narrowed it down to three themes, Russian, Chess or Football. Too narrow this down to one, I will have to do some research on designs and look for inspiration by looking at other websites.

<p>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? <br>

“But a new survey has revealed that a massive 97% of companies have had digital projects that have failed, with 22% claiming it’s a frequent occurrence. Around half claim that failure happens occasionally. Only 3% of all companies surveyed said that their projects never fail.” [4]
According to this quote, making sure you have the correct, methods, skills and resources in place is critical to a successful project. There are other factors that can come into place and can’t be avoided, but we will stick to the factors that only we can have an affect on and not the broader factors that are uncontrollable. 

As mentioned in my coursework, I have stated how digital projects can be successful, therefore not having these methods, skills and resources can lead to an unsuccessful project. 
One method that I assume is debatable, but I think is highly advantageous, is a project manager/leader. Having an individual looking over the project and reviewing each person on the project ensures that everyone is on track with the original goal. Therefore I believe having a project manager/leader is a key role for a successful project. 

I also believe having a clear goal from the start is crucial to a successful project. Everyone needs to be on the same page from the get go. Therefore not having a clear goal and strategy going forward, will be detrimental and will inevitably lead to a failed project. </p>

<p>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? <br>

The main two pieces of software we used were Visual Studio Code and Trello. Before starting the course I always used atom.io as my text-editor, but due to simplicity and me being a beginner to coding, I thought it would be best to use the same text-editor that was being used to teach us, which was Visual Studio Code. Before starting the course, I never used anything like Trello before, so it was completely new to me and after doing some research there are loads of different applications that have the same principles in mind. Again, choosing an application for the use of Kanban is either down to the individual if doing an individual project, or if a team project everyone agrees to choosing the same application which suits everyones needs. Software such as Visual Studio Code is mostly due to preference. If you really wanted to, you can code using a plain-text editor; it just won’t look great at all and has many functions that a text-editor such as Visual Studio Code and many others doesn’t have. </p>

<br>

<p>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control <br> 

As previously stated, before starting the course, the text-editor I used was atom.io, as I thought it’s simplistic look and usability suited my needs as a beginner. However, once I was told that we was going to use a different text-editor, I was hesitant to switch as I had got used to the features and layout of atom.io. I changed because one, It was being taught using visual Studio Code, and two, there’s no harm in learning a new text-editor as every developer uses different software, therefore expanding my knowledge is of no detriment to me. 
Trello is actually very useful and the more you use it and get used to it’s functionality, the more it benefits you. At first I struggled with the true reasoning behind it, but after using it for my previous project (Creating a text-based game using python) and doing further research on it’s methodology for this project, I can appreciate it’s job as a project planner. 
The use of GitHub wasn’t utilised to its full potential, due to this being an individual project. I wasn’t having to upload to GitHub whenever I changed or modified my code. I just used GitHub to upload my website to the internet, or else I would have to have my own domain to upload it to the internet.  </p>

<br>

<p>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? <br>

GDPR summed up is - “GDPR gives data subjects, such as users of online services, a greater degree of control over the processing of their data”[5]. GDPR stands for, General Data Protection Regulation and as stated above, it’s basically a law in place that gives users more control over what data is and isn’t used. This new law was only recently updated in 2018 and before that, the current regulation was adopted in 1995, which when you think about how far the internet has come in the past 20-25 years, is astonishing that the law wasn’t updated earlier, none the less.[6]
If for example, I was about to create a chess website, that lets users login and play chess against other people from all around the world, before the user can even play a game, the user has to give details to the website, to sign up. Therefore, I (or the website) must be GDPR compliant because we are handling personal and sensitive data.
