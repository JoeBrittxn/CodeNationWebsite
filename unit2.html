<p>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page <br>

The basis of my website, is a border around the whole page, a background image which is different for each page and navbar at the top of each page for the user to be able to go to different pages. I also made the text centred and not fill the whole page as this makes the text even more difficult to read. I also added a slightly transparent background behind the text, to make it contrast a bit more and again make it more easily readable.  </p>

<p>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites <br>

“Copyright protects your work and stops others from using it without your permission”[7]. So basically, if you create something or make something, like a picture, then that picture is copyrighted. The only way for someone else to use that picture is for you to grant permission to them exclusively or have stated somewhere that this picture (or whatever it may be) is available to everyone. When designing my webpage I was aware of copyright, therefore I thought it would be a good idea to use my own photos that I have taken, meaning I don’t have to worry about using other peoples creation. </p>

<br>

<p>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them. <br>

The three most common tools a web designer should add to their website, is: screen magnifier, screen reader and speech recognition. Whether a person is partially blind, or completely blind, these three tools can help the person use the internet. </p>

<br>

<p>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites <br>

There are tons of different file formats. Image filetypes, such as: jpg, jpeg, png, pdf, bmp and many more. Video file types: MPV, MP4, AVI, FLV and many more. Compressed files, such as .ZIP and .RAR. When you download a program, it will most likely come in the format of a .EXE file or a DMG file depending if you are a Mac or Windows user. [8] </p>
